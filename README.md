# Car-Price-Prediction-Model

a Python implementation with two ways : 
1. a simple linear regression model with one hot encoding for predicting the selling price of cars based on their mileage, age, and model. The model is trained on a dataset of car prices and is implemented using the scikit-learn library.
2. a simple linear regression model with one hot encoding and label encoding for predicting the selling price of cars based on their mileage, age, and model. The model is trained on a dataset of car prices and is implemented using the scikit-learn library.
